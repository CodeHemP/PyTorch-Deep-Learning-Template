    "# Pytorch Deep Learning Template\n",
    "### A clean and simple template to kick start your project\n",
    "*Francesco Saverio Zuppichini*\n",
    "\n",
    "This template aims to make it easier for you to start a new deep learning computer vision project with PyTorch. The main features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- modularity: we split each logic piece into a different python submodule\n",
    "- data-augmentation: we included [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "- ready to go: by using [poutyne](https://pypi.org/project/Poutyne/) a Keras-like  framework you don't have to write any train loop.\n",
    "- [torchsummary](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary) to show a summary of your models\n",
    "- reduce the learning rate on a plateau\n",
    "- auto-saving the best model\n",
    "- experiment tracking with [comet](https://www.comet.ml/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Let's face it,  usually data scientists are not software engineers and they usually end up with spaghetti code, most of the time on a big unusable Jupiter-notebook. With this repo, you have proposed a clean example of how your code should be split and modularized to make scalability and sharability possible. In this example, we will try to classify Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We have 100 images per class gathered using google images. The dataset is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LyHJxUVjOgDIgGJL4MnDhA10xjejWuw7). You just have to exact it in this folder and run main.py. We are fine-tuning resnet18 and it should be able to reach > 90% accuracy in 5/10 epochs.\n",

    "One good idea is to store all the paths at an interesting location, e.g. the dataset folder, in a shared class that be accessed by anyone in the folder. You should never hardcode any paths and always define them once and import them. So, if you later change your structure you will only have to modify one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a look at `Project.py` we can see how we defined the `data_dir` and the `checkpoint_dir` once for all. We are using the 'new' [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) APIs that supports different OS out of the box, and also make it easier to join and concatenate paths. \n",
